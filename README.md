# Modules and Testing

PR: https://github.com/moayadalhaj/math-series/pull/1

This math series program, a functionality that builds fibonacci, lucas and sum_series serieses using recursion, then test them using pytest.

Problem Domain: you should create a functions that:

- Create fibonacci series, then test it for multiple inputs
- Create locus series, then test it for multiple inputs
- Create sum_series series, that has two optional values to determine if we should use fibonacci or lucas series then test it for multiple inputs

Start time : 5:00 pm

Finish time: 7:00 pm

I learned a new feature for optional arguments while and how to implement pytest on my program solving this lab, it's cool!
